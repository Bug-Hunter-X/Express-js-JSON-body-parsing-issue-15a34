# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with JSON request bodies in Express.js applications. The issue arises when the `express.json()` middleware is not correctly used or is combined with other middleware in a way that interferes with its functionality.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected version.

## Problem

The original code utilizes `express.json()` but may fail to parse the JSON data from the request body under certain circumstances (e.g., large request bodies, improperly formatted JSON). This can lead to the `req.body` object being empty or undefined, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that `express.json()` is correctly placed in the middleware stack and configured appropriately to handle various scenarios.  The improved code adds error handling and uses appropriate settings for `express.json()` to properly parse the JSON data from the request body.
